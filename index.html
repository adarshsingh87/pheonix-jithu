							I first met Jithu, on one of his talks in a clubhouse meet, where he spoke about Robert kiyosaki's " rich dad, poor dad
							". Which was one book, that I was lucky to have read just when I started my career. I used to save first and then spend
							ever since. But from his talk I got new insights, that I had never noticed. I spoke with him during the session and lter
							connected on LinkedIn.
							<br>
							<br>
							From his words, I was very sure that he was the kind of guy who is genuinely interested to help, and I was badly in
							need.
							<br>
							<br>
							My problems were a bad career choice, and confused on choosing a way out. I was happy with the nature of my job during
							the first 3 years of my career as an ai engineer. New technologies, new challenges and the freedom to choose the
							projects. Soon the fairy tale came to an end and the new project was mundane. I realised the same in few months, by then
							we had our daughter and pandemic kicked in.
							<br>
							<br>
							My initial plan was to migrate, that door got shut with the covid, and the days with my family made me to re-think on my
							priorities. I started to think of options staying at my hometown and achieving financial freedom.
							<br>
							<br>
							Clubhouse was a great platform to connect and with minimal clutter and negativity. That's how we met.
							<br>
							<br>
							Jithu spoke with me, listened to me patiently as I blabbered about my past achievements, how I worked on each of my
							projects, my ideas, start ups and all that. And then he analysed all that and we laid down a plan. Nothing drastic, but
							practical and sensible. He understood my passion, my responsibilities, and my resources before he spoke. The time he
							dedicated for that, was meant to be meaningful for both of us. When he shared his vision, I understood why this man is
							taking all this trouble to reach out to people and lend his hand to them. It's seen in all his actions. The way he
							prepare for each talk itself shows, how planned, prepared and committed he is, to his vision.
							<br>
							<br>
							I pray that someday, I could come back and tell him how it all worked out, and how that helped in achieving our goals.
